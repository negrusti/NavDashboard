NMEA Dashboard Privacy Policy
=============================

NMEA Dashboard is an open source app provided at no cost and is intended for
use as is.

This page is required by the Android Play store to inform users of the policies
for collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for users of the
app. If you choose to use the app, then you agree to the terms laid out in this
policy.


Information collection and use
------------------------------

The app does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable data.

The app does not use third-party services that collect information used to
identify you.

The app may display information received from the local device or from a NMEA
network, including potentially sensitive information such as position or the
position of nearby vessels. This information may be stored locally but will not
be shared or transmitted off the device.


Log data
--------

The app does not automatically transmit logs.

The app will display a log locally. If you choose, you may copy this information
and send it to help me debug any issues. If you do this it is your
responsibility to review the log before sending it.

Other applications and services on your phone (such as Google Play services)
may track your usage of this app but I have no control over these.


Cookies
-------

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
anonymous unique identifiers. The app does not use cookies.


Links to other sites
--------------------

This app may contain links to other sites such as github. If you click on a
third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external
sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no
responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
third-party sites or services.


Childrenâ€™s privacy
------------------

The app does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
personally identifiable information from anyone, including from children under
13 years of age.


Changes to this privacy policy
------------------------------

This policy is effective as of 2023-03-08

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes
by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
