This form lets you define new data elements that are derived from existing data.

For example, you could define a "depth below waterline" element that is equal to
"depth at sensor" plus the depth of the fathometer on your boat.

*IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO MAKE MISTAKES AND DEFINE MISLEADING DATA - PLEASE USE
THIS FEATURE WITH CARE!*

# Controls

The middle of the form lists the derived elements that are currently defined:

* Tap an element to edit it
* Long hold an element then drag to change its position
* Tap the trash can next to an element to delete it.
* Tap "Add new page" to add a new derived element.

**Close**: This button closes the form.

# Toolbar

At the top right there are three buttons:

1.  **Copy to clipboard**. Tapping this copies the definition of all derived
    elements to text in the clipboard. You could then paste into a text file or
    an email to synchronize your settings across devices, back them up, or share
    them with others.
2.  **Paste from clipboard**. Tapping this replaces the current derived elements 
    with those in the clipboard. The contents of the clipboard must have
    been been created using the "copy to clipboard" button.
3.  **Help**. Displays this text.
