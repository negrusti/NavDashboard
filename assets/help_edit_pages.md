# Toolbar

At the top right there are four buttons:

1.  **Copy to clipboard**. Tapping this copies the definition of all
    pages and their data to text in the clipboard. You could then paste into a
    text file or an email to synchronize your settings across devices, back them
    up, or share them with others.
2.  **Paste from clipboard**. Tapping this replaces the current pages and their
    data with those in the clipboard. The contents of the clipboard must have
    been been created using the "copy to clipboard" button.
3.  **Reset to default**. Tapping this replaces the current pages and their data
    with the default settings.
4.  **Help**. Displays this text.
