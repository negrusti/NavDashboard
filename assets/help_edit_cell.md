This form lets you define one of the cells on a data page.

# Controls

* **Source**: Where the data to be displayed comes from. Either a network (as
  configured through the "network" menu), the local device, or derived data
  (defined through the "Derived Data" menu).

* **Element**: Which data should be displayed. The elements in this list depend
  on the selected source. Note that not all elements will be available on all
  networks.

* **Display**: How the data should be displayed. All elements support displaying
  the current value, some elements support displaying a graph of the value over
  preselected time ranges. When a history type is selected it will take some
  time to gather the initial data before the graph is first displayed - longer
  history ranges take longer to display the initial data. The app can only
  record history while it the screen is on and the app is displayed.

* **Format**: Which format and units should be used to display the data. The
  formats in this list depend on the selected element.

* **Set Manual Name**: Normally the name of a cell is set automatically based
  on the selected element. If you prefer you can turn "Set Manual Name" on to
  set a different name.

* **Name**: The name that will be displayed next to the data. Only editable if
  "Set Manual Name" is on.

* **Save**: Save the changes and close the form. Alternatively tap the back
  arrow (at the top left) to close the form without saving changes.
